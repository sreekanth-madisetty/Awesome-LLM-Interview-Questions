## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**1. What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It’s a technology that combines two powerful AI tools: a retriever and a generator. The retriever searches external databases, documents, or websites to find relevant information, while the generator (usually a large language model) takes this information and uses it to generate a more accurate and informative response. This allows RAG systems to give answers that are both knowledgeable and up-to-date.

**2. What are the main parts of a RAG system?**

A RAG system has two main parts:
- **Retriever:** Finds and collects relevant information from outside sources (like search engines or specific document sets).
- **Generator:** Uses this retrieved information, along with its own understanding, to create a final answer or output for the user.

**3. Why is RAG better than using an LLM alone?**

LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-4 are trained on data up to a certain date and can become outdated or miss specific details. RAG solves this by looking up current or specialized information as needed. This leads to:
- Answers that include the latest facts.
- More reliable responses with fewer "hallucinations" (made-up facts).
- Higher accuracy, especially for technical or specialized topics like law, medicine, or technology.

**4. How does the RAG pipeline work?**

Here’s a simple step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Get External Data:** External information (like documents) is converted into special numbers (embeddings) so computers can easily compare and search it.
2. **Retrieve Information:** When you ask a question, the system converts your question into numbers too, then finds the most relevant pieces of information.
3. **Augment the Prompt:** The system takes those relevant pieces and adds them to your question.
4. **Generate an Answer:** The updated question (with extra context) is given to the language model, which now generates a better answer using both its own knowledge and the new information.

**5. What is the role of embedding models in RAG systems?**

Embedding models turn words, sentences, or documents into sets of numbers (vectors) so that the system can compare and find similar content. This is crucial for the retriever part of RAG, as it lets the system match your question with the most relevant pieces of information from its database.

**6. What is "chunking" and why is it important in RAG?**

Chunking means breaking large documents into smaller pieces, called "chunks." This helps the retriever find more focused and relevant information instead of searching through huge documents. Choosing the right chunk size is important—too big, and you might miss specific details; too small, and you could lose the overall context.

**7. How does RAG help reduce hallucinations in LLMs?**

Hallucinations happen when an LLM makes up facts. Since RAG includes information pulled directly from real sources, the model’s answers are more likely to reflect actual, up-to-date data, reducing the chances of invented information.

**8. When should you use RAG instead of fine-tuning an LLM?**

Use RAG when:
- Your LLM needs to answer questions based on information that changes often (like news or company data).
- You want to handle topics that are too specialized or detailed for general training.
Use fine-tuning if the needed knowledge is stable and doesn’t change frequently, and you don’t need to look up external sources.

**9. How is external data kept up to date in a RAG system?**

Automated processes can regularly update the external information and their embeddings so that the system always has access to the latest data. This way, the answers stay accurate even as new information comes in.
